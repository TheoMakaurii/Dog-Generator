# Script
This app uses jQuery to make AJAX requests to https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
# 
# The DOM contains a simple submission form which accepts only a number. 
# The number is sent to the dog-api, and retrieves the corresponding number of randomly generated dog images. 
# These images then populate an emptied 'div' tag.
